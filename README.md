# Visualization of Asteroids and their Light Curves
The motivation for this work is to create a program for visualization of asteroids, which is
missing in the astronomical community. The product is a program that displays asteroids
in six different ways and calculates the light curve. For an accurate description of the
asteroid’s surface, the program uses three scattering functions (Lambert’s, Lommel–Seeliger’s,
and Hapke’s) and calculates realistic shadowing. In the theoretical section of the work,
concepts such as light scattering and triangle properties are explained. In the practical section,
these concepts are then implemented using the Python programming language and the VisPy
accelerated graphics library. These tools allow the program to handle hundreds of thousands
of triangles and effectively display asteroids such as (101955) Bennu.

#### The program was created in collaboration with the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University.
